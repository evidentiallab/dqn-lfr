# Deep reinforcement learning-based virtual link embedding for SDN virtual networks

This repository contains the code for the load balancing solutions of the virtual network. The main algorithm is Deep Q Network. ILP and Heuristic are used to compare experimental performance.

## Interger Linear Programming
The Integer Linear Programming is implemented mainly in the ILP directory. The `simple_steiner_tree.py` is the solution for shortest path and the `load_balancing_steiner_tree.py` is the solution for load balancing. The `Graph_generator.py` is used to generate the network model. 

## Heuristic (k-shortest path)
The Heuristic is mainly used with k-shortest path (k = 1, 2, 3 ...). Choose the optimal path based on different metrics. Heuristic is implemented mainly in the `Heuristic` directory.

## Deep Q Network
The main work is implemented using Deep Q Network to balance the resource of the network. In the DQN directory, `the Grid2D_dqn_run.py` is used to train the DQN model. The DQN model's  network layer is in the `Network` directory.
